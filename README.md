#### A guide covering the Go programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Go developer.

## Resources

[Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## Tools

[golang tools](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools) holds the source for various packages and tools that support the Go programming language.

[Go in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) is an extension that gives you language features like IntelliSense, code navigation, symbol search, bracket matching, snippets, and many more that will help you in Golang development.

[Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, etc.) and configures itself automatically and dynamically. Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the only configuration step you need.

[Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) is Git with a cup of tea, painless self-hosted git service. Using Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. 

[OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) is Serverless Functions Made Simple. It makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. Package your code or an existing binary in a Docker image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.

[micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities of modern terminals. As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use. It strives to be enjoyable as a full-time editor for people who prefer to work in a terminal, or those who regularly edit files over SSH.

[Gravitational Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) is a modern security gateway for remotely accessing into Clusters of Linux servers via SSH or SSH-over-HTTPS in a browser or Kubernetes clusters.

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is a simple, secure and performant communications system for digital systems, services and devices. NATS is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). NATS has over 30 client language implementations, and its server can run on-premise, in the cloud, at the edge, and even on a Raspberry Pi. NATS can secure and simplify design and operation of modern distributed systems.

[Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) is a GO program that allows you to run our GitHub Actions locally.

[Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) is an [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) inspired web framework built on top of [Fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), the fastest HTTP engine for Go. Designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind. 

Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) is a vendor Package Management for Golang.

[BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) is an embeddable, persistent and fast key-value (KV) database written in pure Go. It is the underlying database for [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/), a fast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be a performant alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.

[Go kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) is a programming toolkit for building microservices (or elegant monoliths) in Go. We solve common problems in distributed systems and application architecture so you can focus on delivering business value.

[Codis](https://github.com/CodisLabs/codis) is a proxy based high performance Redis cluster solution written in Go.

[zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) is a blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go. 

[HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) is a lightweight high performance HTTP request router (also called multiplexer or just mux for short) for Go.

[Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) is a Go implementation of the WebSocket protocol.

[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) is a debugger for the Go programming language. 

[GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) is a fantastic ORM library for Golang, aims to be developer friendly.

[Go Patterns](https://github.com/tmrts/go-patterns) is a curated collection of idiomatic design & application patterns for Go language.
